The sources mention Eudora email issues, AT&T TV channel problems, and rollover data policies, but none of them contain relevant information about Microsoft's leadership.\n\nTo provide a high-quality answer, I would recommend searching for more up-to-date and relevant sources. As of my knowledge cutoff, Satya Nadella has been the CEO of Microsoft since 2014, but it's possible that there have been updates or changes to this information since then.\n\nIf you'd like, I can try to find more recent information on the current CEO of Microsoft for you!"
