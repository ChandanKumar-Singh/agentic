However, if you are looking for a recipe involving TAJMAAL (a popular Indian dessert), here is one:\n\n**Tajmaal Recipe - Traditional South Asian Semolina Pudding with Dried Fruits and Nuts**\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 cup semolina (sooji)\n- Water, as needed for soaking the raisins/sultanas + extra to cook tajmaal\n- A pinch of saffron threads or a few drops of rose water (optional but traditional in some recipes)\n- 1 cup mixed dried fruits such as raisins, sultanas, and cherries\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter/ghee for greasing the pan\n- A pinch of salt to taste\n- Optional: chopped nuts like almonds or pistachios (to garnish)\n\nInstruCTIONS:\n1. In a bowl, soak the semolina in warm water until it becomes soft and mushy; this usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour. Drain any excess liquid but keep some moisture as you'll need it for cooking later on.\n2. Meanwhile, take another small saucepan or bowl with the dried fruits (raisins/sultanas and cherries) soaked in warm water until they become plump; this should also be done a few hours beforehand to ensure full hydration of the fruit pieces for better texture after cooking.\n3. In another pan, melt butter or ghee over medium heat. Add saffron threads (crushed if whole) and rose water into it along with salt; let them infuse together until fragrant \u2013 this should take about 2 minutes. If you're not using these ingredients for flavor enhancement, simply skip to the next step without adding anything extra at this point.\n4. Add in your soaked semolina and stir continuously with a wooden spoon or ladle until it starts turning golden brown \u2013 about 5-7 minutes of cooking time should do that job well; make sure not to let it burn as the color will darken too quickly once done, which can result in an unpleasant taste.\n5. Once your semolina mixture has reached a nice golden hue and is fully coated with butter/ghee (and saffron-rose water if using), remove from heat immediately to prevent burning \u2013 this should take about 10 minutes of total cooking time, including the initial soaking period.\n6. Now add in your plumped dried fruits and mix well into the semolina mixture; ensure they are evenly distributed throughout for a consistent flavor experience with every bite. If you're using chopped nuts as garnish (which is common), fold them lightly through at this stage to avoid crushing too much of your fruit pieces and maintain their integrity within the pudding mixture.\n7. Grease an ovenproof dish or deep pan with butter/ghee, pour in your semolina-fruit mix ensuring it's evenly spread out across the bottom \u2013 this will help prevent sticking during baking and ensure a uniform texture throughout once cooked through; you can also add extra melted ghee or clarified butter on top for added richness if desired.\n8. Bake in preheated oven at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) until fully set \u2013 this should take about 20-25 minutes depending on your specific dish size and depth; keep an eye out to avoid overcooking which can result in a dryer texture.\n9. Allow the tajmaal pudding cool slightly before serving, as it will continue cooking from residual heat \u2013 this should take about 10-15 minutes of total rest time for optimal consistency and flavor development; serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream/yogurt if desired.\n\nEnjoy your homemade traditional South Asian semolina pudding, TAJMAAL!"
